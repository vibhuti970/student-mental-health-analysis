# Student Mental Health Analysis ‚Äì End-to-End Data Pipeline Project

This project focuses on analyzing student mental health using real-world data and building a complete data pipeline from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to **data streaming with Apache Kafka**, storage in **MySQL**, and final reporting using **Power BI**.

## Project Objective

To explore factors affecting student mental health and build a data pipeline that:
- Collects streaming data using Kafka
- Stores data in a structured MySQL database
- Connects to Power BI for live dashboards and visual analytics

---

## Workflow Overview

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed the `student mental health.csv` dataset using Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- Identified correlations between mental health and features like academic load, parental pressure, sleep patterns, etc.

### 2. **Apache Kafka Setup**
- Created producers and consumers for streaming data:
  - `producer.py`, `producer1.py`, `consumer.py`
- Kafka server and zookeeper configurations (`server.properties`, setup images)
- Topics created to simulate real-time student data flow

### 3. **MySQL Integration**
- Streamed data was pushed into MySQL using connector code (`connectorcode.py`)
- SQL script used for schema creation and data ingestion (`power bi sql connector code.sql`)

### 4. **Power BI Dashboard**
- Connected Power BI to MySQL
- Built interactive visualizations to monitor mental health trends in real-time
- Screenshots: `visualizations on power bi.png`

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required Python packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Set up Kafka and Zookeeper  
4. Run producer and consumer scripts  
5. Set up MySQL and execute `.sql` script  
6. Open Power BI and connect to MySQL to view dashboard
